### jQuery

Query is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Some key features of jQuery include:

- DOM Manipulation: jQuery allows developers to easily select and manipulate DOM elements using CSS-style selectors.

- Event Handling: jQuery provides methods for attaching event handlers to DOM elements, making it easy to respond to user actions like clicks, mouseovers, and keyboard inputs.

- AJAX: jQuery simplifies the process of making asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing developers to fetch data from a server without reloading the entire page.

- Animation: jQuery includes built-in support for creating smooth animations and transitions on web pages.

- Plugins: jQuery has a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing developers to add features like sliders, carousels, and form validation with minimal effort.

For animation exemple, can hide and show divs:

```javascript
//selected div and hide/show
$("div").hide(3000).show(7000)
```
