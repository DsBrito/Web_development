    //Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It makes asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and performs CRUD operations.
    //Different from fetch, axios is a promise-based library, so you can use async/await to make your code look synchronous.
    ///Inside the resp.data. we have the result of the request and dont need wait for the response.json() as in fetch


    
    const url = 'data/states.json'
    axios(url).then(resp => {

        //reduce is a function that can be used to combine all the elements of an array into a single value.
        const itens = resp.data.reduce((html,states) => 
             html += `<li>${states.name} - ${states.acronym}</li>`
        , '')

        //insertAdjacentHTML is a function that can be used to insert a string of text as HTML, into a specified position.
