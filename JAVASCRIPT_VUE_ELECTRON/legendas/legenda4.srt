1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,210
prevously on "grey's anatomy...

3
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,002
i'm george.

4
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,004
we met at the mixer
you had on a black dress

5
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,089
strappy sandalsand a slit up the side.

6
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,717
i've had this thing for
my roommate since, like, day one.

7
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,010
she's pretty great,you know?

8
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,220
who's thatch?

9
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,387
my dad.

10
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,805
thatcher.

11
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,182
she never talks about him.

12
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,808
i'm glad you moved in.

13
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,602
oh, so she moved in with you.

14
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,811
didn't she tell you?

15
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,897
and what i know now is that
when i go into my bedroom,

16
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,981
i'm gonna see that my wife

17
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,900
is cheating on me with mark

18
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,985
who happened to be my best friend.

19
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,200
after careful consideration

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,202
and many sleepless nights

21
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,204
(here's what i've decided)

22
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,291
there's no such thing as a grown-up.

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
we move on. we move out

24
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,391
we move away from our families

25
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,518
and form our own

26
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,103
oh, no

27
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,217
hello?

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,302
no. dr. burke.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,097
yes.

30
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,811
yes, i'll let her know.

31
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,985
that was your landlord.

32
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,986
he wants you to know

33
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,197
that there's a minor flood
in your apartment.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,699
your other apartment.

35
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,411
but the basic insecurities

36
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,288
the basic fears

37
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,791
and all those old wounds
just grow up with us

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,210
i'm exhausted.

39
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,794
me, too.

40
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,006
and just when we think
that life and circumstance

41
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,382
(have forced us to truly)

42
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,718
once and for all become an adult...

43
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,095
i was going at it all night
in the on call room.

44
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,388
what's your excuse?

45
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,017
your mother says something like that

46
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:22,893
mom.

47
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,313
i tell you, that man 
makes me purr like a kitten.

48
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,314
mom.

49
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,816
when he isn't making me
growl like a tiger.

50
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,402
stop.

51
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,487
and my husband wonders

52
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,280
why i'm not interested
in him anymore.

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,282
or worse,something like that

54
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,285
if he had any balls at all,

55
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,995
he would leave on his own.

56
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,998
no. he plays stupid.

57
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,501
he's waiting for me to kick him out.

58
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,002
i come home with a hickey
on my shoulder

59
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,420
a hickey, for god's sake

60
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,506
like i'm some sex-crazed teenager,

61
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,883
which, let's face it,these days, i am,

62
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,011
and what does thatcher do?

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,013
pretends he doesn't see it.

64
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,308
we get bigger
we get taller

65
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,893
we get older

66
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,812
but... for the most part

67
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,480
we're still a bunch of kids

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,317
running around the playground
trying desperately to fit in

69
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,402
you know, he's acting like

70
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,820
i committed a crime,

71
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,614
like my apartment is full of stolen goods.

72
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,616
he's acting like i kept my apartment

73
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,784
to hide stolen goods

74
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,786
so i could do
illegal transplants for money.

75
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,580
are you sure he's not
just acting like you lied

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,414
about moving in?

77
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,292
okay,what's wrong with you?

78
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,503
my mommy's a filthy whore.

79
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,219
you have dirty in your eyes.

80
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,096
you have dirty in your eyes.

81
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,807
i'm not doing dirty with you anymore.

82
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,309
it was a one-time lapse in judgment.

83
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,686
well, it was a 4-time lapse in judgment.

84
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,315
well, it's not gonna happen again.

85
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,316
oh. okay.

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,484
i'm serious.

87
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
we're friends,and it didn't work

88
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,779
when we tried to be more than that.

89
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,489
so...

90
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,782
as fun as it was,

91
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,409
it's not gonna happen again.

92
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,494
stop looking at me.

93
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,621
i'm not looking at you,

94
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,205
i'm rounding.

95
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,080
i'm rounding, too.

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,415
-fine.
-fine.

97
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,584
chuck eaton, 54,

98
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,295
has stage 3b non-small cell
lung cancer

99
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,714
with possible invasion of the pleura

100
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,799
and a history of c.o.p.d.

101
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,302
he's had extensive
chemo-radiotherapy

102
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,596
with minimal regression of the tumor.

103
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,891
he's been admitted
for radical en bloc resection.

104
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,684
i was a smoker.

105
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,687
the, uh, oncologist...

106
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,690
he explained that i have a 25% chance

107
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,400
of surviving the, uh, surgery.

108
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,986
well, unfortunately,that's about right.

109
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,405
if you should elect not to proceed,

110
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,200
we can make you more comfortable.

111
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,413
with all due respect, uh...

112
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,206
there's no way

113
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,084
that you can make a man
dying a slow death comfortable.

114
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,420
i'll roll the dice.

115
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,339
how do i look today?

116
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,882
would you say, you know,
i look nice?

117
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,008
you could usea little more lip gloss,

118
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,009
but, yes,
you're very pretty.

119
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,011
aw, you're mean.

120
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,012
i'm just kidding. you look fine.

121
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,806
seriously, how's my breath?

122
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,016
george.

123
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,393
would you just talk to her?

124
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:09,810
who?

125
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,186
what?

126
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,980
good morning, dr. bailey.

127
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,981
hello, baby.

128
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,982
are the o.r.'s up and running?

129
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,191
uh, yeah,they're fully functional.

130
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,610
uh, except there's some
smoke damage to the corridors.

131
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,486
how about you?

132
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,821
you fully functional?

133
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,780
i'm fine.

134
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,782
how's your husband?

135
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,992
taking him home tomorrow.

136
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,996
yes, we are. yes. yes...

137
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,914
okay,this is not a tea party.

138
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,417
go. work. save some lives.

139
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,210
now!

140
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:38,714
do it now.

141
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,802
jake burton, 15, has advanced 
craniodiaphyseal dysplasia.

142
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,720
was admitted last night

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,013
after complaining of headaches.

144
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,181
and he's not a complainer.

145
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,183
he's been havingsome nausea as well.

146
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,017
really, okay?

147
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:50,684
may i, please?

148
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,519
jake, can i get you to sit up, please?

149
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:52,895
sure.

150
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,188
all right, okay.

151
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,024
now i want you to look 
 right here for me. thank you.

152
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,987
you know, if you pretend
i'm a lion, it helps.

153
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,113
sorry?

154
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:03,989
if you pretend i'm a lion

155
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,782
instead of a really messed up kid,

156
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,993
you get a talking circus animal,

157
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,287
which is way easier to look at.

158
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,289
dr. yang, what's our
immediate concern?

159
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,415
uh, that the bony tumors

160
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,416
are growing inward

161
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,792
and encroaching on his brain.

162
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,305
"invasive non-small cell
with a history of c.o.p.d."?

163
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,600
guy's pretty much a goner, huh?

164
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,187
sensitivity...i like that in a stranger.

165
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,980
are you new here?

166
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,981
visiting.

167
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,191
confounded by all the rain,

168
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,318
and it's only
my first day in town.

169
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,195
you get used to it.

170
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,197
makes me want
to stay in bed all day.

171
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,494
we just met, and already
you're talking about bed.

172
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,495
not very subtle.

173
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,497
subtle's never been my strong suit.

174
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,207
so...

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,502
do you ever go out with co-workers?:

176
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,217
i, um, make it a rule not to.

177
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,012
then i am so glad that i don't work here.

178
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,890
are you hitting on me

179
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,892
in a hospital?

180
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,185
would that be wrong?

181
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:17,980
meredith.

182
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,983
ow. ah.

183
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,986
what the hell was that?

184
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,489
that was mark.

185
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,582
punching out people
on my surgical floor?

186
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,417
my head of neurosurgery

187
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,711
punching out people
on my surgical floor?

188
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,004
put the ice back on your hand, derek.

189
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,505
my hand is fine.

190
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,008
put the damn ice on
your $2-million-a-year hand.

191
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,510
now... would someone tell me

192
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,304
what the hell happened?

193
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,184
that was mark.

194
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,810
who's mark?

195
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,479
he and derek used to work together

196
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,981
back in new york.

197
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,612
and, uh...

198
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,782
they were...we were all close friends

199
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,493
until...

200
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,706
derek found us in bed together.

201
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,920
you put your weight behind it?

202
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,587
yes, sir.

203
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:26,882
well, all right, then.

204
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,516
what the hell is he doing here?

205
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,517
i have no idea.

206
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,480
derek and i always did have
the same taste in women.

207
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,190
excuse me?

208
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,609
you're derek's lusty intern, right?

209
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,987
i heard about you
all the way back in new york.

210
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,490
you're famous.

211
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,491
well...

212
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,202
i heard about you
all the way here in seattle,

213
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,496
so i guess we have a lot in common.

214
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,706
we're the dirty mistresses.

215
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,584
i suppose we are.

216
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,088
my $400-an-hour shrink
says that

217
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,299
it's because behind this rugged
and confident exterior

218
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,593
i'm self-destructive and self-loathing

219
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,012
to an almost pathological degree.

220
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,306
hey, we do have a lot in common.

221
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,308
you know, it's funny.

222
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,309
der...

223
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,813
derek walks in on me
naked with his wife

224
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,815
actually in the throes

225
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,696
and he just turns around
and walks away.

226
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,615
but he sees me
so much as talking to you

227
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,118
and i'm on the ground bleeding.

228
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,288
interesting, don't you think?

229
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,797
what do you think you're doing?

230
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,798
you need stitches.

231
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,800
i know. hold the mirror.

232
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,480
why is he suturing his own face?

233
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,398
to turn me on.

234
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,317
because he's mark sloan.

235
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,111
he's like the go-to plastic surgeon
on the east coast.

236
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,988
that's the guy
addison was sleeping with?

237
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,989
well, you can't really
blame her, can you?

238
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,490
no, not really.

239
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:16,783
yes, you can.

240
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,204
mcsexy wants an x-ray
to check for fractures,

241
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,414
and i think it's a bad idea if i take him.

242
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,415
why? why?

243
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,293
i'm on it. why is it a bad idea?

244
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,586
mcsexy?

245
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,212
no?

246
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,006
mm. mcyummy.

247
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,008
-no
-no.

248
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,885
mcsteamy.

249
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,720
ah, there it is.
yep.

250
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,182
oh, excuse me,

251
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,018
i'm just chokin' back some mcvomit.

252
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,020
ooh.

253
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,396
i saw her first.

254
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,982
the night she met shepherd,

255
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,400
i had her ear.

256
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,194
we talked,

257
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,696
and i can't even remember what i said.

258
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,782
you know when you haven't
had sex for awhile,

259
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,909
you sort of forget how good it is

260
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,702
and don't really need it much?

261
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,996
yeah, that doesn't happen to guys.

262
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,498
it's like a beas...

263
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,207
a beast that was asleep

264
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,793
for a long,long time.

265
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,795
and now the beast is wide awake

266
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,004
and wants to be fed,

267
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,881
and the food that alex gave it was...

268
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,800
it was

269
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,009
good food, george.

270
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,511
something needs to be done
about your taste.

271
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,012
ah! you're just jealous

272
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,181
because you're beast is still asleep.

273
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,599
eh, my beast isn't asleep.

274
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,685
my beast never sleeps.

275
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:31,817
mr. eaton.

276
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,403
do you need a hand with that?

277
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,196
um, if you could set up the tripod,

278
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,198
that would be very helpful.

279
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,116
are you...

280
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,701
what are you doing?

281
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,995
i'm dying, dear.

282
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:44,997
one in four...

283
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,710
i, uh, i've never done well
with odds like that.

284
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,004
some...some people are lucky.

285
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,297
i just never have been.

286
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,299
the camera's for posterity,

287
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,718
for saying good-bye.

288
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,095
do you want me to hold
the camera for you?

289
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,181
you're very kind.thank you.

290
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,815
okay, we're recording.

291
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,321
this...this is a message

292
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,489
for suzie zelman

293
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,908
my...my college sweetheart

294
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,202
and...and the love of my life.

295
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,786
suzie...

296
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,916
i loved you with my whole heart...

297
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,793
and i never would've
stopped loving you

298
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,795
if you hadn't been the vile whore

299
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,589
to ever walk the planet earth.

300
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,216
you deserve that...

301
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,592
that drunken imbecile

302
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,803
that you slept with and then married.

303
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,597
and when, at the reunion,

304
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,601
i..i met your ugly children

305
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,603
i knew you had done me a real favor.

306
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,981
i am so deeply happy

307
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,815
that i'll never have to see

308
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,983
your face again.

309
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,613
love, chuck.

310
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:02,991
would you please, uh,

311
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,618
put in a fresh tape, dear?

312
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:06,912
what about that

313
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,497
jaw reconstruction you did

314
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,414
using a microvascular

315
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,792
free transfer from the foot?

316
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,919
you interested in plastics?

317
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,796
absolutely.

318
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,798
you might want to consider a transfer

319
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,091
to new york or los angeles.

320
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,385
you're not gonna see
any heat up here.

321
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,304
well, actually...

322
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,389
you ever seen an advanced case

323
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,891
of craniodiaphyseal dysplasia?

324
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,310
lionitis?

325
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,604
restrained driver

326
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,814
in a minor m.v.c.

327
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,983
vitals are stable,but witnesses saw

328
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,901
seizure activity behind the wheel.

329
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,319
i really don't think i need to be here.

330
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,821
you should really let us
determine that, ma'am.

331
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,780
witnesses said she was

332
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,281
screaming, shuddering

333
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,116
and--and clamping her jaw.

334
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:44,992
do you have a seizure disorder

335
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:45,909
that you're aware of?

336
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:46,618
epilepsy?

337
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,495
it's not epilepsy.i don't have any

338
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,414
oh, no. oh, god.

339
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,582
it's happening again.

340
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,792
oh, no.

341
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,982
was that a...

342
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,609
did she just have a...

343
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:19,902
orgasm.

344
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,907
spontaneous orgasms.

345
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:25,991
are you sure?

346
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,910
kinda ha to miss.

347
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:31,497

348
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,998

351
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,585
talking about... you know,

352
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,794
may as well get familiar.

353
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,795
okay, pamela,

354
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,505

355
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,380
how long this has

356
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,715
been happening to you?

357
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,217
for a few months,

358
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,092
i guess.

359
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:44,718
how often?

360
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,513
about, i don't know,
seven or eight times a day.

361
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,597
every day?

362
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,516
uh, dr. stevens.

363
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,308
i'm sorry.

364
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,393
every day?

365
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,187
yes, every day.

366
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,106
 and you haven't seen
a doctor about this before?

367
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,983
it not exactly something
you want to cure, is it?

368
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,109
dr. o'malley

369
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,486
sorry.

370
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:02,986
mum...is it?

371
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,696
i went to my doctor.

372
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,781
he sent me to a shrink.

373
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,991

374
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,202

377
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,999
he's your emergency contact person.

378
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,502
pammy, what happened?

379
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:19,711

00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,980
she's a junior at u-dub.

386
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,108
she's a math major.

387
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,110
the last three semesters,
she made the honor roll.

388
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,904
high up in the honor roll.

389
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,992
mr. calva, we're gonna...

390
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:50,701
run some tests

391
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,286
and we're gonna...

392
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,328
we're gonna figure out what's

393
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,289
causing your daughter's...

394
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,582
episodes.
 this right, episodes.

395
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,416
okay.

396
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,001
and when you were 14,

397
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:02,796
you stole laura brendese
right out from under me.

398
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,381
you knew how i felt about her.

399
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,215
don't say you didn't know

400
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,508
because you knew.

401
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,386
and you went for her anyway.

402
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,681
what kind of human being
does that to his little brother?

403
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,685
he was 14. cut him some slack
for god's sakes.

404
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,814
oh, i'm sorry.
i forgot we were recording.

405
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,192
if you wouldn't mind just rewinding

406
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,902
a little bit, please?

407
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,489
i'm a doctor, not a videographer.

408
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,992
and i do need to prep you for surgery.

409
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,993
but you offered to help.

410
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,704
when i thought
you were saying good-bye.

411
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,706
i am saying good-bye.

412
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,084
none of these people not one of them

413
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,295
knows how i really feel.

414
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,005
my whole life,

415
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,299
i've kept it all inside.

416
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,218
i-i don't want to carry this

417
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,011
with me to my grave.

418
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,888
you seem like such a nice man.

419
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,099
wouldn't you just rather
you remember you that way?

420
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,395
no.

421
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,688
please rewind the tape.

422
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,400
okay, jake

423
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,985
it can get a little cramped in there,

424
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,403
so you have to try not to move.

425
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,489
yeah, uh, this is, like,

426
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,408
my 50th m.r.i. experience.

427
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,618
right, sorry.

428
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,411
it's okay.

429
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,205
you have really nice eyes,

430
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:19,915
you know?

431
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,708
well, i'm just sayin' that

432
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,584
you're mostly all...

433
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,586
all surly and hard core,

434
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,004
but your eyes aren't.

435
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,799
i'm really big on eyes.

436
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,509
they're the only part of my face

437
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,510
where tumors aren't growing.

438
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,013
yeah, you've got nice eyes.

439
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,014
yeah?

440
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:36,181
mm-hmm.

441
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,391
you..you get that...

442
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,309
that i'm jailbait, right?

443
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,107
meredith.

444
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:45,983
chief.

445
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:47,401
chief

446
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,486

447
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,613
not work-related?

448
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,198
okay.

449
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,617
do you remember my father?

450
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,496
of course.

451
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,914
do you know why he left?

452
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,085
i believe your mother asked him to.

453
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,421
right, but do you know why?

454
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,217
no.

455
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,886
no, i'm sorry. i don't.

456
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,513

457
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,306

461
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,318
it's precision work.

462
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,402
it won't be easy, but--

463
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,113
dr. sloan, can i help you 
with something?

464
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,282
he says he can fix my face.

465
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,992
he says he can make me
look like normal.

466
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,583
what did he say?

467
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,001
did you hear that?

468
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,211
did he call him a crack whore?

469
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,587
-why would he call him a crack whore?
-oh, shut up.

470
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:49,588
i'm trying to read lips.

471
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,215
look, shepherd's gesturing.

472
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:51,507
big gesturing.

473
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,091
what do you got?

474
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,384
shepherd and sloan battling it out.

475
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,512
oh, it's gettin' good.

476
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,888
why, what do you got?

477
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,391
just a woman down in the e.r...

478
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,186
having spontaneous orgasms.

479
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,317
wait, wait, wait. wait.

480
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,319
that is not the point.

481
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,196
the point is the kid wants his
face fixed and i want to do it.

482
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:14,613
the point is,

483
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,697
you wanna get published!

484
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,115
well, yeah.

485
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,992
and i'm guessing your chief
of surgery does, too.

486
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
you know how the press loves

487
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,203

to say no to this jackass.

494
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,589
but as chief--

495
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,882
please don't say it.

496
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,010
dr. sloan, if you can get the parents

497
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,220

00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:51,900

oh, come on.

509
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,310
you're not even
a little bit happy to see me?

510
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,395
go home. whatever it is

511
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,188
you came here to do,

512
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,397
just drop it and leave.

513
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,982
hey, we all made mistakes,

514
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:32,983
addison, all three of us...
mark...

515
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,484
but somehow...somehow,

516
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,694
i lost my best friend

517
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,486
and the woman i loved.

518
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,697
please... don't say that.

519
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,617
he doesn't know how we felt.

520
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,701
he doesn't know you stayed

521
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,703
with me after he left.

522
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,580
how do you expect
to work out a marriage

523
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,080
if you can't even

524
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,790
be honest with him?

525
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,083
why are you here?

526
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,585
for one reason...

527
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,419
to bring you home.

528
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,090
i miss you, addison.

529
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,512
i'm in love with my husband, mark.

530
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,013
but he's not in love with you.

531
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,099
he's in love with that intern,

532
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,101
and he's not even trying to hide it.

533
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,604
now why would you want
to stick around for that?

534
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:19,988
i think you're making it up.

535
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,114
i'm not.

536
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,909
-i saw it four times.
-what?

537
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,702
a woman with spontaneous orgasms.

538
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,579
really

539
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,915
you're just jealous 'cause
you didn't see it yourself.

540
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,083
oh, i totally am.

541
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,919
spontaneous orgasms, really?

542
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,087
you look really nice today.

543
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,505
any chance they're contagious?

544
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:37,881
spontaneous orgasms.

545
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,008
it's that would solve so many problems.

546
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,594
it would. it would.

547
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,804
i think you smell nice, too.

548
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:44,596
you know, it's like,

549
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,514
you see someone throw up,

550
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,306
it makes you want to throw up too.

551
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,391
kinda like that?

552
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:47,891
kinda like.

553
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,604
you know what? i'm not hungry.

554
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,313
do you hear me?

555
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,398
i'm not hungry.

556
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:55,899
neither is the beast.

557
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,193
"the beast"...is that, like,

558
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,112
some sly reference to your penis?

559
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,697
get your mind out of
the gutter, crack whore.

560
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,784
no, it's not alex's penis.

561
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:06,410
it's...you know

562
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,995
when you haven't had
sex for a long time

563
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:08,787
and you forget how good it is,

564
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,205
and so you want it less?

565
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:12,499
yeah, that doesn't happen to me.

566
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:13,792
me either.

567
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,793
me either.

568
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,216
i grew my hair for her,and...

569
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:21,592
i know.

570
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,010
i don't even think she's noticed.

571
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:25,512
you could just try

572
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,388
telling her how you feel.

573
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,308
um, guys?

574
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,101
she's moving,

575
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,311
like, a lot.

576
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,687
pamela,

577
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:34,980
you have to hold still.

578
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,112
okay.

579
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,494
that's not helping the beast sleep, is it?

580
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,286
no.

581
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:50,787
no, it's not.

582
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,416
you're drawing the medial to the tumor.

583
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,585
-yeah,
-it's a guideline

584
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,420
for what the bone structure should be.

585
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,087
hear that?

586
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,215
i'm gonna have bone structure.

587
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,009
jake...

588
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,886
so what do you think,am i a dal?

589
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,679
or more of a picasso?

590
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,307
could you stop doing that

591
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,308
for a minute, please?

592
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,689
jake...

593
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,984
jake... i'm sorry.

594
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,987
this surgery,the brain surgery,

595
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:24,905
is very dangerous.

596
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:25,697
no, don't say that.

597
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,783
y-you don't get to change your mind.

598
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:28,909
you know, i know dr. sloan

599
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,287
has made you some big promises,

600
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,497
but the bony tumors

601
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,416
inside your skull are bad.

602
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,501
i don't care.

603
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,794
the bleeding will be hard to control.

604
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:39,711
i'm not trying to frighten you,

605
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,213
-i just want you to under--
-i do understand.

606
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,297
i understand

607
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,216
that this has nothing to do
with the plastic surgery.

608
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,509
so if i'm gonna be under

609
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,301
the knife anyway, then--

610
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,886
-the plastic surgery could--
-sorry to interrupt--

611
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,596
what you need to understand--

612
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,389
excuse me.

613
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,306
jakes actually right.

614
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,892
no reason to put him through

615
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:54,685
a second surgery

616
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,687
and a second round of anesthesia.

617
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,981
it's much safer just to
do it all at once.

618
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,482
honey, we just want to focus

619
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,483
on keeping you alive.

620
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,610
mom, i-i almost died

621
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,904
when i was 10 years old.

622
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:06,989
and then again when i was 12.

623
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,992
and then again last year.

624
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,910
but...but

625
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,786
but i'm still alive.

626
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,412
i'm still alive,

627
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:14,997
so i say we go for it.

628
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,081
jake...

629
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,500
look, i know that you think

630
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,710
i'm perfect just the way i am--

631
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,005
but that's your job to do that.

632
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:26,216
but... for once in my life,

633
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,719
i'd like to think

634
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,888
that someone else thought that.

635
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,016
please.

636
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,314
please.

637
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:54,119
you've given up surgery

638
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,621
to go into clerical work?

639
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,706
i'm fulfilling a patient's dying wish

640
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,916
by sending hate mail

641
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,584
to everyone he's ever met.

642
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,293
yeah,

643
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,588
right now i understand the impulse.

644
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,006
me, too.

645
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,216
why do people cheat?

646
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,301
that's a good question.

647
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,095
why do you think she cheated on you?

648
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,806
were you different then?

649
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:16,892
were you a bad husband?

650
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:23,315
 i was, uh...

651
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,491
oh, i was just a little...absent.

652
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,494
not that that's an excuse for her.

653
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:37,996
do you think things

654
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:38,789
would've been different

655
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,581
if you'd had kids?

656
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,584
do i think

657
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,002
she wouldn't have cheated?

658
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:48,799
i don't know.

659
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,387
all right, man, jake's ready to roll.

660
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,304
i'm sorry.

661
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,389
did i interrupt something?

662
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,807
no. it's fine.

663
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,397
pamela,

664
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,816
you should really try and relax.

665
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,317
i am trying to relax.

666
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,319
the episodes happen

667
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,406
when i don't relax.

668
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:16,285
do you really think you can fix this?

669
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:22,583
i, uh, i hate to be insensitive, but...

670
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,292
would it be the worst thing

671
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,293
ever if we can't?

672
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,919
i mean...

673
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,213
you know, i like sex
as much as the next girl,

674
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,506
like in bed

675
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,300
or even in private.

676
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,386
but when you can't go to the movies

677
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,096
or drive a car

678
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,516
or go to church with your parents...

679
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,601
oh, my god.

680
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,313
you know that dream

681
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:45,606
where you show up at high school

682
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,398
and you're naked?

683
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:47,357
yeah.

684
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,903
yeah, well, i would really,

685
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:52,196
really like to wake up.

686
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:01,288
it's crossed

687
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,499
the intrathoracic fascia?

688
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,208
i'm afraid so.

689
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,294
i'm gonna have to go into the chest wall.

690
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,883
he made 17 hate tapes.

691
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:13,383
i'm sorry?

692
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,385
videotapes of himself

693
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,513
telling people how much he hated them

694
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,682
spewing every hurt feeling he ever had.

695
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,183
and he mailed them?

696
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:21,517
no.

697
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,685
he wanted me to, but i don't

698
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,394
think it's a good idea.

699
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,397
he was scared.

700
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,106
he was in shock.

701
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,399
he wasn't thinking clearly.

702
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,195
that's not for you to decide, dr. grey.

703
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,906
he asked you for something,

704
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:36,990
and you told him you would do it.

705
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:38,116
if you don't,

706
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,993
that doesn't make you noble.

707
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:41,912
it makes you a liar.

708
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,208
did you know she kept her artment?

709
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,090
yeah.i did. sorry.

710
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,014
and now...

711
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:02,391
dr. shepherd

712
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:05,185
-is opening the skull-cap.
-is it harder to get

713
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,479
-through the bony tumors?
-that's what he's doin'.

714
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,981
yes, he is.

715
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,109
basin.this idone.

716
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:12,818
cottonoid.

717
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:15,988
give me the sponge.

718
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:18,991
oh, son of a bitch

719
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,785
all right

720
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:22,619
hang another unit of blood.

721
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,704
oh i got

722
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,621
somebody change that bag of blood, please.

723
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:24,997
that's too much blood.

724
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,998
put it in the pressure infuser.

725
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:26,498
no carotid.

726
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,583
we've got v-fib.

727
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,292
start c.p.r. and bag him.

728
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,501
paddles.get the paddles.

729
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,294
he's losing a lot of blood.

730
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:31,503
someone get f.f.p.

731
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,087

charging.

733
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:32,796
clear.

734
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,320
shame he never had his face fixed.

735
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,287
dr. sloan.

736
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:06,914
yeah.

737
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,090
all right.

738
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,009
i got the parents' approval.

739
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,014
you don't...really need those.

740
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:24,515
oh, right.

741
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,316
scalpel.

742
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,784

without parents to defy

831
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,110

832
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,118
we throw tantrums

833
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,204

834
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:27,706

835
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,416

837
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,087
she doesn't even hear me when i talk.

838
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,510
she will if you make her.

839
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,600

840
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:49,811

her father left, you know?

848
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,391
i think she knows about us, ellis.

849
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,601
i think she's figured it out.

850
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,812
she's 5 years old,richard.

851
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:34,606
we look for comfort

852
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,191
where we can find it...

853
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,699
this seat taken?

854
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,286
i guess not.

855
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:48,620
double scotch,

856
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,080
single malt.

857
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:55,794
you look sad.

858
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:04,511
i just saw my father

859
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,513
for the first time in 20 years.

860
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,515
how'd that go?

861
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,017
it coulda gone better.

862
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:16,899
what are you still doing here?

863
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:23,405
i'm hoping addison shows up.

864
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,409
you're still in love with her?

865
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:35,083
you're still in love with him.

866
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,502
she won't show, you know?

867
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,003
no?

868
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:40,589
he's not the kind of guy

869
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,007
you leave if you can help it.

870
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:47,095
what if you're wrong?

871
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,183
what if, just this once,

872
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,811
life comes down on the side

873
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,897
of the dirty mistresses?

874
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,607
and we hope...

875
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:00,692
against all logic

876
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,403
against all experience.

877
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:17,793
like children...

878
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,296
we never give up hope.

879
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,220
come in.

880
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,991
i know i'm not
a world-renowned surgeon.

881
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,118
and i know i'm not a lot of things

882
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,996
that you've gone for in the past.

883
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:56,206
i know.

884
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,004
but...

885
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:02,796
i would never leave you.

886
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,093
i would never hurt you.

887
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,685
and i will never stop loving you.
